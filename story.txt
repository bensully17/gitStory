once upon a time…
there was a pterodactyl named Larry.
Unlike the other pterodactyls, Larry had a gentle soul.
Until one day when he met his nemesis, Donte.
Donte was incredibly jealous of Larry’s perfectly smooth complexion.
So in the middle of the night, while Larry was sleeping, Donte painted Larry's skin brown.
